The Spout SDK files can either be included directly in your project or compiled as a dll.

The Spout applications and examples have been compiled with the SDK files included in the projects and so are not dependent on a Spout dll.

To use the .dll created from this project in your code define SPOUT_IMPORT_DLL in your preprocessor compilation defines.

Thanks and credit to Malcolm Bechard for creating the dll project.
